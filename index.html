          The Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) in Melbourne consistently boasts the highest attendance 
          figures among all stadiums in Australia, year after year. <br><br> Despite the geographical 
          proximity of other stadiums like Docklands Stadium and Traeger Park, the MCG consistently 
          attracts nearly double the average attendance compared to these venues.

            Did you know that in 2020, the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG), typically 
            bustling with over 100,000 fans, had no attendance due to the COVID-19 pandemic? 
            <br><br>
            For the first time in its history, the MCG stood empty for AFL matches, 
            including the iconic Anzac Day clash and the Grand Final, which was moved to the Gabba in Brisbane. 
            <br><br>
            To fact check this, simply click on year 2020. You will notice no circular marks depicting
            MCG stadium.

          Did you know that there are no major AFL stadiums in the northern, northeastern, and northwestern regions of Australia? 
          This means that areas like the Northern Territory and parts of Queensland and Western Australia 
          lack the large-scale stadiums found in other parts of the country. 
          <br><br>
          This highlights the concentration of major sporting infrastructure in the southern and eastern regions of Australia,
          where cities like Melbourne, Sydney, and Perth host the majority of AFL games.

          <br><br>
          They had a particularly strong home record at the MCG, which was a fortress for them. 
          Their away performance was solid as well with 8 wins in 12 games

          They managed to lose 14 times, only winning 21% of their fixtures.

          Keep in mind that this occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic when attendance restrictions were in place.

          Each vertical axis represent a different variable. Each line represents a specific match
          played by that particular team. 
          <br><br>
          Trace a line through the different vertical axis to identify the relationship between factors.
          E.g Line starts high on Attendance axis and drops low on Maximum Temperature axis. Indicates high attendance during
          colder weather. 
          <br><br>
          If many lines follow similar direction, there is a relationship between the 2 factors. If the lines are in random 
          pattern with no clear direction, it indicates a lack of relationship between the factors

          You may be able to notice gaps in the Ridgeline Chart for certain rounds. This is because
          the team in question qualifies for that playoffs hence, the total point restarts to 0
          <br><br>
          If the gaps are bigger and stretched across multiple rounds, this indicates the team in question did not 
          qualify for playoffs and hence would not be able to gain any points in those rounds.

          Did you know that Carlton, Collingwood, and Essendon are tied for the most AFL premierships, 
          each with 16 titles. This intense competition has fueled some of the most memorable matches in AFL history where
          the rivalry between these 3 teams continue every season
          <br><br>
          These teams are so evenly matched that, year after year, their point progressions and points obtained 
          each round are remarkably close. This leads to incredibly intense and exciting seasons for their loyal fans
